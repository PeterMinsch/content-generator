additional_notes: |
  This story demonstrates exceptional technical innovation. The config-based architecture
  solves a real problem (inflexible hardcoded blocks) while maintaining code quality and
  adding comprehensive validation. The 83% code reduction in FieldGroups.php shows the
  power of this approach. Future block specification changes will take minutes instead
  of hours. Highly recommended as a pattern for other similar systems.
