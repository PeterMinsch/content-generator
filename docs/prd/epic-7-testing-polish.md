## Story 7.1: Write PHPUnit Tests for Core Services

**As a** plugin developer
**I want** comprehensive unit tests for business logic
**So that** code changes don't introduce regressions

### Acceptance Criteria

1. PHPUnit test suite configured with WordPress test framework
2. Test coverage for critical services:
   - `OpenAIService`: API communication, error handling, response parsing
   - `PromptTemplateEngine`: variable substitution, template management
   - `ContentGenerationService`: generation workflow, validation
   - `CostTrackingService`: cost calculation, budget checks
   - `ImageMatchingService`: tag matching algorithm, fallback logic
   - `CSVParser`: parsing, encoding handling, validation
3. Tests cover:
   - Success scenarios (happy path)
   - Error scenarios (API errors, validation failures)
   - Edge cases (empty data, malformed input)
4. Mocking for external dependencies (OpenAI API calls)
5. Tests run via `composer test` command
6. All tests pass in CI environment

### Technical Requirements

- Test location: `tests/php/`
- Bootstrap WordPress test environment
- Use `WP_UnitTestCase` for WordPress-aware tests
- Mock OpenAI responses with fixtures
- Code coverage goal: 80%+ on service layer
- Run: `composer run test` or `phpunit`

## Story 7.2: Create Integration Tests for REST API

**As a** plugin developer
**I want** integration tests for API endpoints
**So that** API contracts are verified

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Integration tests for REST endpoints:
   - `POST /pages/{id}/generate` - single block generation
   - `POST /pages/{id}/generate-all` - bulk generation

   - `POST /import/csv` - CSV import
2. Tests verify:
   - Endpoint accessibility and authentication
   - Request validation and error responses
   - Successful responses with correct data structure
   - Permission checks (unauthorized access blocked)
   - Nonce verification
3. Tests use real WordPress database (test database)
4. Tests clean up after themselves (delete test posts)
5. ACF fields properly saved and retrieved

### Technical Requirements

- Test class: `WP_UnitTestCase` with REST API helpers
- Use `wp_set_current_user()` to test permissions
- Mock OpenAI calls to avoid API costs in tests

## Epic Dependencies

- All epics (1-6) must be complete before final testing

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Critical bug discovered late in testing
**Mitigation:** Allow buffer time for bug fixes, prioritize ruthlessly

**Risk:** Documentation incomplete or unclear
**Mitigation:** Have non-technical user review docs, iterate based on feedback

**Risk:** Performance targets not met
**Mitigation:** Profile and optimize, adjust PRD targets if necessary, document trade-offs

**Risk:** Security vulnerability found
**Mitigation:** Fix immediately, consider delayed release if critical
