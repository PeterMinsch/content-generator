# Story 5.7: Folder-Based Image Organization

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** site administrator,
**I want** to upload entire folders of images and have them automatically categorized by folder name,
**So that** I can organize images more efficiently and the matching algorithm can use folder names as keywords

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Folder upload interface enhancement:
   - Button: "Upload Folder" in addition to existing "Upload Files"
   - Uses HTML5 `webkitdirectory` attribute for folder selection
   - Supports nested folders (flat structure, preserves folder names)
   - Browser compatibility notice for unsupported browsers

2. Automatic folder-based categorization:
   - When folder uploaded, extract folder name as category
   - Create/assign taxonomy term matching folder name to all images in folder
   - Example: `wedding-bands/` folder → all images tagged with "wedding-bands"
   - Nested folders: use parent folder name as tag (e.g., `jewelry/rings/` → "rings" tag)

3. Enhanced keyword matching algorithm:
   - ImageMatchingService updated to prioritize folder-based tags
   - Folder tags weighted higher than individual image tags in matching
   - Fallback order: folder name match → combined tags → individual tags → default
   - Log folder-based matches separately for debugging

4. Folder management in Image Library:
   - Grid view shows "Folder" badge/label on images uploaded via folder
   - Filter dropdown includes "Filter by Folder" option
   - Bulk operations: "Change Folder" action to reassign folder tag

5. Settings for folder organization:
   - Settings > Image Library tab: "Folder Organization" section
   - Checkbox: "Preserve folder structure on upload" (default: enabled)
   - Checkbox: "Use folder name as primary tag" (default: enabled)
   - Help text explaining feature

6. Backward compatibility:
   - Existing individual file uploads continue to work unchanged
   - Existing tagged images not affected
   - Folder tags work alongside manual tags (additive, not replacement)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

**Current Image Library Implementation (Stories 5.1-5.6):**

From Story 5.6 completion notes, the current system uses:
- Individual file uploads (multiple files supported)
- Tag-based organization using `image_tag` taxonomy
- ImageMatchingService with 3-level fallback algorithm (all tags → 2 tags → 1 tag → default)
- Meta field: `_seo_library_image = 1` marks images as part of library
- Settings stored in: `seo_generator_image_settings` option
- Auto-assignment integrated with ContentGenerationService

**Files to Modify:**
- `templates/admin/image-library.php` - Add folder upload button and UI
- `assets/js/image-library.js` - Handle folder upload client-side
- `includes/Controllers/ImageUploadController.php` - Process folder information
- `includes/Services/ImageMatchingService.php` - Enhanced matching algorithm
- `includes/Admin/ImageLibraryPage.php` - Folder filtering
- `includes/Admin/SettingsPage.php` - Folder settings
- `includes/Services/ContentGenerationService.php` - Pass folder context

**New Files to Create:**
- `tests/php/Integration/FolderBasedImageOrganizationTest.php` - Integration tests

**Browser Compatibility:**

The `webkitdirectory` attribute is supported in:
- Chrome 21+
- Edge 13+
- Firefox 50+
- NOT supported: Safari on iOS, IE 11

Must include fallback message for unsupported browsers.

**HTML5 File API - Folder Upload:**

```javascript
// Example: Folder upload implementation
const folderInput = document.createElement('input');
folderInput.type = 'file';
folderInput.webkitdirectory = true;
folderInput.multiple = true;

folderInput.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
    const files = Array.from(e.target.files);

    // Group files by folder
    const folders = {};
    files.forEach(file => {
        // file.webkitRelativePath contains: "folder/subfolder/image.jpg"
        const pathParts = file.webkitRelativePath.split('/');
        const folderName = pathParts[pathParts.length - 2]; // Immediate parent folder

        if (!folders[folderName]) {
            folders[folderName] = [];
        }
        folders[folderName].push(file);
    });

    // Upload each folder group
    Object.entries(folders).forEach(([folderName, folderFiles]) => {
        uploadFolderImages(folderName, folderFiles);
    });
});
```

**Folder Taxonomy Structure:**

Folder names will be sanitized and stored as `image_tag` taxonomy terms, just like manual tags:
- Folder: `wedding-bands` → Term: `wedding-bands`
- Folder: `Men's Rings` → Term: `mens-rings` (sanitized)
- Folder: `Jewelry/Gold` → Term: `gold` (parent folder)

**Meta Field Storage:**

New post meta for images:
- `_seo_image_folder` - Stores original folder path (e.g., "jewelry/rings")
- Used for filtering and display in admin grid
- Not used for matching (matching uses taxonomy terms)

**Enhanced Matching Algorithm:**

Current algorithm (Story 5.4):
1. Extract keywords from context
2. Match ALL tags (AND)
3. Fallback: Match first 2 tags
4. Fallback: Match first 1 tag
5. Fallback: Default image

Enhanced algorithm (Story 5.7):
1. Extract keywords AND folder names from context
2. **New:** Match folder tag FIRST (folder-named images prioritized)
3. If no folder match, proceed with existing tag-based algorithm
4. Match ALL tags (AND)
5. Fallback: Match first 2 tags
6. Fallback: Match first 1 tag
7. Fallback: Default image

**Settings Structure:**

Add to existing `seo_generator_image_settings` option:
```php
[
    'default_image_id' => 123,  // From Story 5.6
    'preserve_folder_structure' => true,  // New in 5.7
    'use_folder_as_primary_tag' => true,  // New in 5.7
]
```

**Folder-Based Context Building:**

When generating content, extract potential folder keywords:
```php
// Example: Generating content for "Platinum Men's Wedding Bands"
$context = [
    'focus_keyword' => 'platinum mens wedding bands',
    'topic' => 'wedding jewelry',
    'category' => 'Rings',
    'potential_folders' => ['wedding-bands', 'mens-rings', 'platinum']  // New
];
```

**REST API Update:**

Current endpoint:
```
POST /wp-json/seo-generator/v1/images
Body: { file: <binary> }
```

Enhanced endpoint:
```
POST /wp-json/seo-generator/v1/images
Body: {
    file: <binary>,
    folder_name: "wedding-bands"  // Optional, new parameter
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:**

This enhancement is fully backward compatible:
- Existing uploads without `folder_name` work unchanged
- Existing tagged images continue to work
- Folder tags are additive (don't replace manual tags)
- Existing ImageMatchingService fallback logic preserved

**Code Quality Standards:**

Per architecture.md:
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards
- Type hint parameters and return values (PHP 8.0+)
- PHPDoc comments for all methods
- Use dependency injection
- ABSPATH guard in PHP files
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Escape all outputs
- Use WordPress functions (`sanitize_title`, `wp_set_object_terms`)

### Testing

**Test Approach:**
- Integration tests for folder upload and categorization
- Unit tests for folder name extraction and sanitization
- Integration tests for enhanced matching algorithm
- Manual testing for browser compatibility

**Test File Location:**
- `tests/php/Integration/FolderBasedImageOrganizationTest.php`

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. Upload folder with multiple images → all images tagged with folder name
2. Upload nested folder → images tagged with parent folder name
3. Folder-based keyword matching → folder images prioritized
4. Fallback to tag-based matching when no folder match
5. Folder name sanitization (spaces, special chars)
6. Settings persistence (preserve_folder_structure, use_folder_as_primary_tag)
7. Backward compatibility with existing uploads
8. Folder filtering in admin grid
9. Bulk folder reassignment

**Testing Framework:**
- PHPUnit 9.x for PHP tests
- WordPress test framework utilities
- Create mock folder structures in tests

**Browser Compatibility Testing:**
- Manual testing in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Verify fallback message in unsupported browsers (Safari iOS, IE11)

### Completion Notes

Story 5.7 successfully implemented folder-based image organization for the Image Library system.

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Folder Upload UI**: Added "Upload Folder" button with HTML5 `webkitdirectory` attribute support, including browser compatibility detection for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

2. **Backend Folder Processing**: Enhanced ImageUploadController to accept optional `folder_name` parameter, automatically create/assign folder taxonomy terms, and store folder metadata in `_seo_image_folder` meta field.

3. **Enhanced Matching Algorithm**: Updated ImageMatchingService to prioritize folder-based tags before falling back to standard tag-based matching. New `findMatchingImageByFolder()` method implements folder-priority matching.

4. **Folder Filtering**: Added folder filter dropdown to Image Library page with folder badges displayed on images. Backend methods added to retrieve unique folders and filter by folder.

5. **Settings Integration**: Added "Folder Organization" section to Image Library settings with checkboxes for "Preserve Folder Structure" and "Use Folder as Primary Tag" with proper sanitization.

6. **Folder Tag Management**: Implemented `sanitize_folder_name()` utility in ImageUploadController to handle special characters, spaces, and ensure lowercase with hyphens.

7. **Integration Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite covering folder-based matching prioritization, tag-based fallback, name sanitization, backward compatibility, and settings persistence.

**All Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- AC 1-6: All acceptance criteria successfully implemented and tested
- Backward compatibility maintained
