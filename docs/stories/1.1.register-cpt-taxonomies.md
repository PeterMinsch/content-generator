## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

**Tech Stack:**
- PHP: 8.0+ (use modern PHP features: named arguments, union types)
- WordPress: 6.0+
- CMS Platform: WordPress with native Custom Post Type and Taxonomy APIs
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

**Project Structure:**
```
includes/
├── PostTypes/
│   └── SEOPage.php
├── Taxonomies/
│   ├── SEOTopic.php
│   └── ImageTag.php
├── Activation.php
└── Plugin.php
```
[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

**Architectural Patterns:**
- **Custom Post Type Pattern:** Use WordPress native `register_post_type()` to leverage built-in content management features (revisions, permissions, REST API)
- **Observer Pattern (WordPress Hooks):** Register post types and taxonomies on the `init` action hook to ensure WordPress core is fully loaded
[Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

**Custom Post Type Configuration (from PRD):**
```php
register_post_type('seo-page', [
    'labels' => [
        'name' => 'SEO Pages',
        'singular_name' => 'SEO Page'
    ],
    'public' => true,
    'has_archive' => false,
    'hierarchical' => false,
    'supports' => ['title', 'editor', 'thumbnail', 'revisions'],
    'show_in_rest' => true,
    'menu_icon' => 'dashicons-admin-page'
]);
```
[Source: PRD prd.md#architecture-custom-post-type]

**Taxonomy Default Terms (from PRD):**
- seo-topic: Engagement Rings, Wedding Bands, Men's Wedding Bands, Women's Wedding Bands, Education, Comparisons
- image_tag: platinum, gold, white-gold, rose-gold, tungsten, titanium (metals), wedding-band, engagement-ring, fashion (types), mens, womens, unisex (gender), classic, modern, vintage, minimalist (styles), polished, brushed, hammered, matte (finishes)
[Source: PRD prd.md#taxonomy-and-image-tag-taxonomy]

**Namespace Convention:**
- Base namespace: `SEOGenerator\`
- Post types: `SEOGenerator\PostTypes\`
- Taxonomies: `SEOGenerator\Taxonomies\`
[Source: architecture.md#plugin-architecture]

**WordPress Functions Required:**
- `register_post_type()` - Register custom post type
- `register_taxonomy()` - Register taxonomy
- `add_action('init', ...)` - Hook registration functions
- `wp_insert_term()` - Create default terms on activation
- `term_exists()` - Check if term already exists before inserting

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- `tests/php/PostTypes/SEOPageTest.php`
- `tests/php/Taxonomies/SEOTopicTest.php`
- `tests/php/Taxonomies/ImageTagTest.php`

**Testing Framework:**
- PHPUnit 9.x with WordPress test framework
- Use `WP_UnitTestCase` for WordPress-aware tests
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Verify post type is registered with correct arguments
- Verify taxonomies are registered and assigned to correct post types
- Verify default terms are created on activation
- Test that post type shows in REST API
- Test that taxonomies show in REST API (where applicable)
[Source: PRD prd.md#testing-requirements]

**Coding Standards:**
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)
- Run PHP_CodeSniffer: `composer run phpcs`
- All files must have ABSPATH guard: `defined('ABSPATH') || exit;`

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1 - Custom Post Type Configuration:**
- ✓ **Given** a WordPress installation with this plugin active
- ✓ **When** the plugin initializes on the `init` hook
- ✓ **Then** `seo-page` CPT is registered with title, editor, thumbnail, revisions support
- ✓ **And** shows in REST API at `/wp-json/wp/v2/seo-pages`
- ✓ **And** uses dashicons-admin-page icon
- ✓ **And** appears at menu position 30
- **Evidence:** `includes/PostTypes/SEOPage.php:59-81`, Tests: `SEOPageTest.php:20-55`

**AC2 - SEO Topic Taxonomy:**
- ✓ **Given** the plugin is activated
- ✓ **When** taxonomies are registered on `init` hook
- ✓ **Then** `seo-topic` non-hierarchical taxonomy is created
- ✓ **And** assigned to `seo-page` post type
- ✓ **And** shows in REST API
- ✓ **And** default terms are created: Engagement Rings, Wedding Bands, Men's Wedding Bands, Women's Wedding Bands, Education, Comparisons
- **Evidence:** `includes/Taxonomies/SEOTopic.php:28-65`, `includes/Activation.php:102-116`

**AC3 - Image Tag Taxonomy:**
- ✓ **Given** the plugin is activated
- ✓ **When** taxonomies are registered
- ✓ **Then** `image_tag` non-hierarchical taxonomy is created
- ✓ **And** assigned to `attachment` post type
- ✓ **And** all 20 default tags are created across 5 categories (metals, types, gender, styles, finishes)
- **Evidence:** `includes/Taxonomies/ImageTag.php`, `includes/Activation.php:118-151`

**AC4 - Init Hook Registration:**
- ✓ **Given** WordPress loads the plugin
- ✓ **When** `plugins_loaded` fires
- ✓ **Then** Plugin singleton initializes
- ✓ **And** all post types/taxonomies register on `init` hook
- **Evidence:** `includes/Plugin.php:79`, `content-generator.php:40`

**AC5 - WordPress Coding Standards:**
- ✓ **Given** the codebase
- ✓ **When** analyzed against WordPress Coding Standards
- ✓ **Then** all files comply with WPCS
- ✓ **And** proper namespacing is used throughout
- ✓ **And** security best practices are followed
- **Evidence:** All source files, PHPDoc blocks, ABSPATH guards

### Security Review

**Status: PASS - No Issues Found**

**Positive Security Findings:**
1. ✅ **ABSPATH Guards:** All PHP files include `defined( 'ABSPATH' ) || exit;`
2. ✅ **Version Validation:** Activation.php checks PHP ≥8.0 and WordPress ≥6.0 before proceeding
3. ✅ **Dependency Check:** ACF plugin existence verified before activation
4. ✅ **Output Escaping:** All user-facing strings use proper escaping functions (`esc_html__()`, `_x()`, `__()`)
5. ✅ **SQL Safety:** Uses WordPress `$wpdb` with proper charset/collate handling and `dbDelta()` for safe schema updates
6. ✅ **Prevent Singleton Bypass:** `__clone()` private, `__wakeup()` throws exception
7. ✅ **Capability Checks:** Post type uses standard `capability_type => 'post'` for WordPress permission system

**No Critical or Medium Severity Issues**

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS - Optimized Implementation**

**Performance Strengths:**
1. ✅ **Efficient Hook Usage:** Components only register when needed
2. ✅ **Database Optimization:** Custom table includes proper indexes (idx_post_id, idx_created_at, idx_cost_tracking)
3. ✅ **Singleton Pattern:** Prevents multiple instantiations, reduces memory overhead
4. ✅ **Lazy Loading:** DI container instantiates components on-demand
5. ✅ **Taxonomy Registration:** Registers taxonomies before post types (WordPress best practice)
6. ✅ **Rewrite Rule Optimization:** `flush_rewrite_rules()` only called on activation, not every page load

**No Performance Issues Identified**

### Testability Assessment

**Status: Excellent**

**Controllability:** ✅ All components can be instantiated and tested independently
**Observability:** ✅ Public methods provide clear interfaces for verification
**Debuggability:** ✅ Comprehensive PHPDoc and clear error messages

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Post type registration tests (4 test methods)
- ✅ Taxonomy registration tests (3 test methods each)
- ✅ Activation process tests (6 test methods)
- ✅ Configuration validation tests
- ✅ Default term creation tests

**Test Quality:** Tests use WordPress test framework properly with `WP_UnitTestCase`, factory methods, and proper assertions.

### Non-Functional Requirements Validation

**Maintainability: PASS**
- Clear code structure with single responsibility classes
- Comprehensive PHPDoc comments
- Logical file organization matching architecture spec
- No code duplication
- Constants used for taxonomy/post type slugs (DRY principle)

**Reliability: PASS**
- Robust error handling with version checks
- Prevents duplicate term creation with `term_exists()` check
- Safe database operations with `dbDelta()`
- Proper exception handling in singleton

**Compatibility: PASS**
- PHP 8.0+ requirement enforced
- WordPress 6.0+ requirement enforced
- ACF dependency checked
- Uses WordPress native APIs throughout

### Technical Debt Assessment

**Current Technical Debt: None**

**Future Enhancements (Low Priority):**
1. Consider extracting default terms to a configuration file or filter for easier customization without code changes
2. Consider adding custom capability type mapping for granular permissions in future stories (currently uses standard 'post' capabilities which is appropriate for MVP)
3. Admin notice after activation confirming successful setup could improve UX (non-critical)

### Files Modified During Review
