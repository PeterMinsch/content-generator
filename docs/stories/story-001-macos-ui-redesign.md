- **Agent Model Used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Story
**As a** Plugin administrator
**I want** The SEO Generator plugin to have a modern, macOS-inspired interface with our brand colors

2. SF Pro font stack implemented with proper fallbacks
3. Type scale and spacing system defined
4. CSV Import page components implemented (drop zone, settings cards, buttons, column mapping)

## Dev Notes
- Reference design spec: `docs/design-spec-macos-ui.md`
- All design tokens and specifications are in the design spec file
- Start with design system foundation, then build components
- Phase 1 priority: CSV Import page
- Phase 2: SEO Pages List
- Phase 3: Global components (sidebar, navigation)
- Use vanilla CSS with CSS variables (no framework required)
- WordPress admin enqueue for proper loading
