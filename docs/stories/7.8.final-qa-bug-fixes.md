   - Medium/Low: defer to next version
2. All critical and high priority bugs fixed and tested
3. Regression testing after bug fixes
4. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
5. WordPress version compatibility tested:
   - WordPress 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3+
   - PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2
6. Plugin activation/deactivation tested (no errors)
7. Multi-site compatibility tested (if supporting multisite)
8. Final code cleanup:
   - Remove debug code and console.logs
   - Remove unused files and dependencies
   - Fix coding standards violations

[Source: PRD prd.md#browser-support]

### Plugin Activation/Deactivation Hooks

**Activation (`register_activation_hook`):**
```php
// Create custom tables
$this->createGenerationLogTable();

// Set default options
$this->initializeDefaultSettings();

// Register ACF field groups
$this->registerACFFields();

// Flush rewrite rules
flush_rewrite_rules();
```

**Deactivation (`register_deactivation_hook`):**
```php
// Flush rewrite rules
flush_rewrite_rules();

// Do NOT delete data (let user decide)
```

**Uninstall (`register_uninstall_hook` or uninstall.php):**
```php
// Delete custom tables
// Delete all plugin options
// Delete all post meta
// Delete all posts with post_type = 'seo-page'
// Only if user confirms data deletion
```
[Source: Architecture architecture.md#plugin-architecture]

### Coding Standards Commands

**PHP_CodeSniffer:**
```bash
# Check standards
composer run phpcs

# Auto-fix issues
composer run phpcbf

# Check security standards
composer run phpcs -- --standard=WordPress-Security
```

**ESLint:**
```bash
# Check standards
npm run lint:js

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:js -- --fix
```
[Source: Architecture architecture.md#code-quality]

### Common Bug Patterns to Check

**PHP Issues:**
- Undefined variables or indexes
- Type errors (strict types in PHP 8)
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Missing nonce checks
- Missing capability checks
- Uncaught exceptions

**JavaScript Issues:**
- Undefined properties
- React key warnings
- Memory leaks (event listeners not cleaned up)
- Race conditions in async operations
- Missing error boundaries

**WordPress-Specific:**
- Missing `defined('ABSPATH') || exit;`
- Direct $_POST/$_GET access without sanitization
- Echo without escaping
- $wpdb queries without prepare()
- Hooks fired at wrong priority
[Source: PRD prd.md#security]

### Testing Environments

**Local Testing:**
- Use Local by Flywheel with different WP/PHP versions
- Fresh install for activation testing
- Test with sample content

**Staging Testing:**
- Real hosting environment
- Test with actual OpenAI API
- Test with production-like data volume

**Cross-Browser Testing:**
- Use BrowserStack or similar for comprehensive testing
- Test on real devices (macOS Safari, iOS Safari)
[Source: Architecture architecture.md#development-workflow]

### Regression Test Coverage

**Critical Workflows to Test:**
1. Generate single block
2. Generate all blocks (full page)
3. Regenerate existing block
4. Edit generated content manually
5. Save draft and publish
6. Upload and tag images
7. Import CSV with multiple pages
8. Configure settings and save
9. View cost analytics
10. Frontend page display

**Test Scenarios:**
- Happy path (everything works)
- Error scenarios (API failures, timeouts)
- Edge cases (empty data, special characters)
- Concurrent operations (multiple users)
[Source: Epic epic-7-testing-polish.md#story-7.8]

### Theme Compatibility Notes

**Frontend Template:**
Plugin provides `single-seo-page.php` template. If theme doesn't override, plugin template used via template hierarchy.

**Admin Interface:**
Should be isolated from theme styles. Use `.seo-generator-admin` wrapper class to scope styles.

**Block Rendering:**
Each block has standalone template in `templates/frontend/blocks/`. Should work with any theme.
[Source: Architecture architecture.md#frontend-display]

### Plugin Compatibility Concerns

**SEO Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math):**
- May override meta descriptions
- Solution: Allow user to choose which plugin controls SEO meta

**Page Builders (Elementor, Beaver Builder):**
- May not display ACF fields properly
- Solution: Document that plugin uses custom template

**Caching Plugins (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache):**
- May cache admin AJAX requests
- Solution: Exclude admin-ajax.php from caching

**Security Plugins (Wordfence):**
- May block OpenAI API requests
- Solution: Document firewall whitelisting
[Source: Epic epic-7-testing-polish.md#story-7.8]

### Multi-Site Considerations

**Per-Site Settings:**
- Each site should have own OpenAI API key
- Each site has own generation logs
- Each site has own image library

**Network-Wide vs. Per-Site:**
- Plugin can be activated per-site or network-wide
- Settings always per-site
- Database tables use site prefix (e.g., wp_2_seo_generation_log)

**Testing Multi-Site:**
- Create network with 3 sub-sites
- Activate plugin on each
- Verify data isolation
[Source: Architecture architecture.md#database-schema]

- [ ] All error_log() debug statements removed
- [ ] WP_DEBUG statements removed

**Remove Comments:**

```bash
# Run all tests
composer run test
npm run test

# Check coverage
composer run test -- --coverage
npm run test -- --coverage

# Verify coverage thresholds met (80%+ on services)
```

**Browser Testing:**
- Use real browsers, not just emulation
- Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
- Test on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

**Compatibility Testing:**
- Use fresh WordPress installs for each version
- Use clean database (no other plugins)
